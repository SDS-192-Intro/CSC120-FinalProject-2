# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

 My overall approach was to figure out the overall classes and design, write out everything on paper, and then code. I had to learn how to use the Guava map in order to this project. I'm not sure there's anything I wish I had implemented differently-- if I had more time, I would have more specific/appropriate commands for the water in the pond (right now you have to climb on to the pond and the water is on the pond). My friend told me there should be a more present element of time throughout the game so you don't get surprised, which was really helpful. I would say to start coding earlier & just get things on paper.
